              (MIT) in 1957. Dr. Kalam is a pioneer in fibre glass technology and led a young team to initiate this effort
              in ISRO from design, development leading to production of composites rocket motor cases.
              <mark>Dr. Kalam made significant contribution as Project Director to develop India's first indigenous Satellite Launch
                Vehicle (SLV-3) which successfully injected the Rohini satellite in the near earth orbit in July 1980 and
                made India an exclusive member of Space Club.</mark>

                across the country. During the last decade, Dr. Kalam has addressed over five million youth below the age
                of 17 and inspired them to become an active participant of India Vision 2020. He has addressed several children

            <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the
              Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort,
              but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his
              lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival,
              he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed
              dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly:
              "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"</p>
